installation
turn off virus protection
some virus protection programs can interfere with the 
microsoft office or microsoft access sr stand
alone version installation program  if you use a virus 
protection program on your computer  turn it off before 
installing  you can turn the virus protection program 
back on after installation is complete  
note if your virusprotection program starts 
automatically when you start windows  you can turn it off 
by restarting windows while holding down the shift key problems installing to a folder whose name contains 
punctuation characters
do not use a comma    single quotation mark    or 
exclamation point   in the name of the folder where you 
install access sr  it is recommended that you use the 
default folder or use only letters and numbers in folder

if you are trying to save space on your disk  try setting 
access or the individual feature to  installed on first 
use  instead  
installing access sr on a network
    to create an administrative installation point for 
access sr 
  create a share on a network server for the 
 administrative installation point  the network share 
 must have at least megabytes mb of available 
 disk space  
  on a computer that is running microsoft windows  
 windows nt workstation or windows nt server and that 
 has write permission to the share  connect to the 
 server share  
  on the start menu  click run  and then click browse  
  on office disc in the cdrom drive  select setup exe 
 and click open  
  on the command line following setup exe  type 
 a data msi 
 and click ok  
 for example  
 e  setup exe a data msi 
  when prompted  enter the organization name that you 
 want to define for all users who install office from 
 this location  
  when prompted for the installation location  enter the 
 server and share you created  
for more information about network and administration 
issues  see the office resource kit web site at  
http www microsoft comofficeork
prompt for cd key when installing from an administrative 
installation 
when you install access sr on your computer from an 
administrative installation on a server  you might be 
prompted for a cd key  this occurs if the system 
administrator who created the administrative 
installation did not enter the cd key to solve this problem  ask the system administrator to 
create a new administrative installation and enter the cd 
key in the first dialog box  after this has been done  
you will not be prompted for the cd key when you install 
access sr from this new administrative installation  
message  file already in use  when running access sr 
from a network
if you are running access sr from the network  you 
might receive the following message when you open an 
access database 
 could not use  admin   file already in use this message occurs when a user who has write permissions 
to the network share opens an access database  subsequent 
users who have only read permissions to that share 
receive the message when they attempt to open an access 
database  
after you have run the administrative installation of 
office or access sr  you can prevent this message 
by setting the effective sharelevel permissions to read 
permissions for all users who will run access sr from 
the network server  if you are an administrator  you 
might want to create a separate share to the same folder  
and give any administrators full control permissions so 
that they can maintain the files in this folder  however  
all users should install office or access sr from 
the share with read permissions  
installing access sr over an access runtime 
application
if you are upgrading from access or office on a
computer where you have installed an access runtime 
application  the default installation location for office 
 or access sr is 
 c  program files officek
installing office or access sr to this alternate 
default location ensures that you keep the access 
version of msaccess exe if it is needed by the runtime 
application unexpected message during installation
if you get an unexpected message during the installation 
of office  and you get the same message when you try to 
install office again  you can create a log file that will 
be useful to microsoft product support services in 
troubleshooting the problem  once you create the file  
you will need to call microsoft product support services     to create the log file 
 
  click the start button on the taskbar  and then click 
 run   in the open box  type  
 
  path  setup exe l v c  verboselog txt
 
 where  path  is the location of setup exe  for 
 example  if you are installing from a cdrom drive  
 then the text you would type might look like 
  d  setup exe l v c  verboselog txt
   click ok  
setup will start again and a log file called 
verboselog txt will be created at the root of your c  
drive installing access sr without removing the beta build 
of office 
when starting access sr  you might receive the 
following message  
 required registry information is missing and this 
 application cannot run  please rerun setup to correct 
 this problem  
or  after a few seconds  the program might quit  
you might experience either of the above if you installed 
access sr without removing the beta build b of 
microsoft office      to solve this problem  do the following to remove the 
beta build of office  
  click the start button on the taskbar  point to 
 settings  and click control panel   doubleclick the addremove programs icon   in the list of installed programs  click microsoft 
 office premium edition  this is the beta 
 version of office    click addremove   click remove office   click yes to the prompt confirming that you want to 
 remove access sr shortcut on the programs menu varies 
according to your operating system 
the access sr shortcut on the programs menu might have 
the following problems  
  it does not selfrepair the program  
 this problem occurs because your operating system does 
 not support windows installer shortcuts  only the 
 following versions of microsoft windows support these 
 shortcuts  
   windows 
   windows with internet explorer    service 
 pack and active desktop installed
   microsoft windows nt version with 
 internet explorer    service pack   and 
 active desktop installed  
 note  if you install internet explorer on a computer 
 that has windows or windows nt version with 
 internet explorer    service pack   and active 
 desktop installed  it will still support windows 
 installer shortcuts  
  it does not install the program on first use  
 this problem occurs because installed on first use is 
 not an option for access in the selecting features 
 dialog box during setup  installed on first use is not 
 an option because your operating system does not 
 support windows installer shortcuts  the operating 
 systems listed under   support windows installer 
 shortcuts  
  it does not display a path on the shortcut tab of the 
 properties dialog box for the shortcut  
 this indicates that the shortcut is a windows 
 installer shortcut  windows installer shortcuts do not 
 directly reference the path of the shortcut target  
 instead  they contain a token that the windows 
 installer resolves to the path of the shortcut 
 target  the operating systems listed under item 
 support windows installer shortcuts working with access sr displaying dates with fourdigit years 
in access sr  you can specify that date fields and 
controls display fourdigit years  this helps you to 
ensure that the century of a particular date is correct  
on the general tab of the options dialog box tools 
menu  under use fourdigit year formatting  you can do 
one of the following 
  select the this database check box to display four
 digit years at the database level in the current 
 access database or access project 
  select the all databases check box to display four
 digit years at the application level in all access 
 databases and access projects selecting one of these check boxes only changes how dates 
are displayedit does not change the data itself  these 
options override format property settings for individual 
fields and controls euro symbol not printed correctly 
although the euro symbol might be displayed correctly in 
print preview  it might not print correctly  for example  
it might not appear at all in the printout  or it might
appear as another character  
this behavior can occur if you are using a printer font 
that does not support the euro  to resolve this problem  
first try using a true type font that does support the 
euro  such as arial  courier new  or times new roman  if 
the euro symbol still isn t printed correctly  change the 
spool data format for your printer from emf to raw  
    to change the spool data format for your printer from 
emf to raw 
  click the start button  point to settings  and then 
 click printers   in the printers dialog box  rightclick your printer  
 and then click properties   in the  printer  properties dialog box  click the 
 details tab  and then click spool settings   in the spool data format box  change the setting from 
 emf to raw for more information  contact your printer vendor maximum number of levels of nested forms or reports
the maximum number of nested forms or reports is seven  out of memory  message on windows nt server   or 
windows nt workstation  you might receive an  out of memory  message when you 
attempt to save or close a large access database or 
access project on windows nt workstation   or windows 
nt server    to prevent this message  install windows 
nt   service pack   
enclosing controls or using tooltips in a rectangle
in a form or data access page  if you enclose a control 
or use a tooltip in a rectangle  it might not be 
displayed correctly  to ensure that the control or 
tooltip is displayed correctly  open the form or data 
access page in design view  click the rectangle  and then 
click send to back on the format menu using the image control in a data access page
in access sr  you cannot bind an image control in a 
data access page to an ole object field in an underlying 
table  however  you can use an image control in a data 
access page to display a different picture for each 
record  in the table  create a text field that contains 
the urls of the pictures  then in the data access page 
based on the table  add an unbound image control  and set 
its controlsource property to that field print commands unavailable when data access page is 
selected in database window
when a data access page is selected in the database 
window  the page setup  print preview  and print commands 
on the file menu are unavailable  you might also receive 
the following message when you try to use the printout 
action in a macro  or when you try to use printout method 
of the docmd object in a visual basic for applications 
vba procedure  
 runtime error     the command or action 
  printout  isn t available now to use these commands  or to use the printout action or 
method  first make sure that the data access page is 
open  undefined function  message when opening data access 
page
in a data access page  if you use a function that is not 
available outside of access  you receive the following 
message when you open the page in microsoft internet 
explorer  
 undefined function   functionname   in expression for example  you receive this message if your data access 
page is based on a query in which an expression contains 
nz  euroconvert  eval  or a userdefined function  you 
also receive this message if you use a function that is 
not available outside of access in a control on a data 
access page  the message does not appear when you open 
the data access page in access preventing unauthorized access from scripts in data 
access pages
you can provide security against scripts that run in a 
data access page and attempt to access databases on 
servers other than the one the page was downloaded from  
for more information  see  creating secure data access 
pages  dap security doc and  deploying data access 
pages on the internet  dap internet deployment doc in 
the appendixes folder on the companion cdrom to the 
microsoft office visual basic programmer s guide  
you can also obtain these documents on microsoft s web 
site at the office developer s forum  you can find more 
information in chapter    securing access databases   
in the microsoft office visual basic programmer s 
guide  
color palette in data access pages when display is 
configured to use colors
data access pages might not be displayed correctly on 
computers where the color palette of the video display is 
set to color or less  if you need to ensure that data 
access pages appear correctly on color or color 
video displays  limit the colors that you use to those

problems when using taskbar buttons to navigate between 
multiple data access pages
if you have installed the active desktop  and in internet 
explorer you have cleared the check box to launch 
browser windows in a separate process  you might 
experience problems if you open multiple data access 
pages and move between them by clicking their 
corresponding taskbar buttons  for example  if you open 
one data access page and you then open a second data 
access page in another window  in some cases you might 
not be able to navigate back to the first page until you 
have closed the second page  to prevent this behavior  
start internet explorer  click internet options on the 
tools menu  and on the advanced tab  select the check box 
to launch browser windows in a separate process  
display problems when scrolling through the employees 
form in northwind
in the northwind sample database  the display might 
flicker when you scroll through the records in the 
employees form  
    to prevent this problem  
  in windows control panel  doubleclick the display 
 icon  and then click the settings tab   in the color palette box  click a setting with more 
 than colors  note  if your system does not support more than 
 colors  you will not be able to select a higher 
 setting using northwind sample database located on a readonly 
share
if you open a copy of the northwind sample database that 
is located on a readonly share  you might receive the 
following message 
 there were errors fixing your data access page 
 connections  some pages may not function as expected when you first open the northwind sample database  it 
attempts to fix the connections of its data access pages  
this process checks the file attribute of northwind  if 
the attribute is readonly  the process cannot fix the 
connections  and execution stops without error  however  
the fixup process does not check the permissions of the 
network share where northwind is located  if the share is 
readonly  the connections cannot be fixed  
this behavior may occur in any database containing 
similar code that fixes data access page connections  if 
you are deploying northwind or any database with a 
similar fixup process on a readonly share  you can avoid 
this problem by setting the file attribute of the 
database to readonly  you can also prevent the fixup 
process from running by pressing the shift key while you 
open the northwind sample database  however  this might 
mean that the data access pages will not function as 
expected  
obtaining microsoft office proofing tools
microsoft office proofing tools is an addin package 
for office that contains all the language tools 
microsoft makes for more than languages  it can be 
obtained from a licensed reseller  the part and sku 
numbers listed in help are incorrect  see 
http www microsoft comoffice for more information on 
obtaining office proofing tools  
webbot components not in office developer
some topics in help erroneously state that microsoft 
office webbot components and associated white papers are 
available in microsoft office developer  webbot 
components are not available in this release of office 
 developer  
colors may not display correctly on color monitors
after you view popup windows in help topics  colors for 
some elements may no longer display correctly on 
color monitors  for example  the following elements may 
appear differently on the screen after you view popup 
windows 
  bitmaps
  pictures embedded in files
  office assistant
  hyperlinks
to fix the display problem  change the color palette for 
your monitor     to change the color palette 
  click start on the windows taskbar  point to settings  
 and then click control panel   doubleclick the display icon   on the settings tab  select an option other than 
 colors  microsoft recommends that you choose more than 
 colors  if such an option is available considerations for using access adp projects 
against sql server 
you must install office sr or access sr 
updates or better to test your access adp applications against 
sql server   the officeaccess sr updates allow you
to design database diagrams  tables  and views  but do not 
allow you to save your changes  this is due to the metadata 
changes happened between sql server   and sql server   
the sr update also fixes the ability for access forms and 
reports to run against stored procedures  sr supports the 
design and saving of stored procedures future updates of office and access available after 
sql server ships will allow limited design and saving of 
database diagrams  tables  and views                                                          
microsoft jet
ansi compliant sql
the microsoft jet   database engine supports two forms 
of sql syntax  one mode supports the same jet sql 
commands used in previous versions of access  and another 
new mode supports new jet sql commands and syntax that 
are more compliant with the ansi sql standard  the 
mode that supports the sql commands used in previous 
versions of access is the only mode that is available 
through the access sr user interface  the newer sql 
syntax is currently available only in visual basic for 
applications vba procedures that use activex data 
objects ado and the microsoft ole db provider for jet 
version  x  when you use the ole db provider for jet 
version  x through ado  you can execute temporary 
queries i e   queries that are not stored and are used 
as part of a recordset s source by using 
connection execute or command execute or create stored 
queries by using the new create view  create procedure 
syntax  
although you can use ado and the ole db provider for jet 
 x to access all stored queries created through the ole 
db provider for jet  x  they are not visible in the 
access user interface  for example  you cannot set the 
recordsource property of a form to a query created with 
the microsoft activex data objects extensions for ddl and 
security adox version   object library  and you 
cannot import a query created with adox into another 
database  however  you can still use ado code to run 
stored queries created by using adox if you try to save a new query and receive a message that 
the name you entered already exists for another object  
try using a different name  an ansi query with the 
same name might already exist  but might not be visible 
in the objects list in the database window  
for more information about ansi compliant sql with the 
microsoft ole db provider for jet version  x  type 
comparison of jet sql and ansi sql in the office 
assistant or on the answer wizard tab in the help window  
and then click search  
counter and identity 
counter and identity are microsoft jet sql reserved 
words  but they are not jet sql data types  for more 
information about the microsoft jet data types  see the 
microsoft jet database engine programmer s guide 
published by microsoft press                                                        
conversion and compatibility
compatibility library
access sr does not ship with the dao   x 
compatibility library  if you attempt to convert an 
access database in which the code contains older versions 
of dao objects  methods  and properties that depend on 
the dao   x compatibility library  you might receive 
a message that there were compilation errors during the 
conversion of the database  if the dao   x 
compatibility library that shipped with a previous 
version of access still exists on your computer  you can 
create a reference to it and then use it  however  before 
you convert an access database on a computer where the 
dao   x compatibility library does not exist  you 
must update the code so that it does not depend on 
that library  
turning on name autocorrect in a converted access 
database
by default  name autocorrect is not turned on in a 
converted access database  to turn on name autocorrect  
click options on the tools menu  click the general tab  
and under name autocorrect  select the appropriate check 
boxes  then open each table  query  form  and report in 
design view  save the object  and close it for more information  type name autocorrect in the 
office assistant or on the answer wizard tab in the help 
window  and then click search  or see the microsoft 
office update web site at 
http officeupdate microsoft comdefault htm                                                          
microsoft access projects 
unexpected behavior when sql statement output contains 
two fields with same name
in an access project   adp  you might see unexpected 
results when you use an sql statement whose output 
contains two or more fields with the same name  for 
example  you might see unexpected behavior when you 
work with a view that is based on two tables and that 
contains two fields that have the same name but are 
located in different tables  to prevent unexpected 
behavior  specify an alias for one of the fields to 
ensure that every field in the output has a unique name  
can t refer to controls in forms or reports in aggregate 
functions
in an access project  your aggregate functions cannot use 
references to controls in objects such as forms or 
reports  for example  you cannot use the following 
expression 
  dlookup categoryname   categories   categoryid   
 reports report categoryid 
rebooting your computer after installing microsoft data 
engine msde
to ensure that microsoft data engine msde runs 
correctly  you must reboot your computer after installing 
msde  if you do not reboot your computer  you might see 
unexpected behavior while using msde  for example  if you 
attempt to create a new publication from an access 
project  you might receive a message that one of the 
library files needed to run this application cannot be 
found error   for more information about msde  type 
work with a microsoft access project in the office 
assistant or on the answer wizard tab in the help window  
and then click search  order by clause may not be used in this query type  when 
view has top clause
when you save a view that contains a top clause and an 
order by clause  you might receive the message  order by 
clause may not be used in this query type   however  when 
you run the query  it returns the correct results and no 
message appears incoming named pipe connections not supported on windows 
 or windows 
you cannot connect to a remote microsoft data engine 
msde or sql server   desktop database located on a 
windows or windows computer unless you use a 
protocol other than named pipes  these platforms do not 
support incoming named pipe connections  to connect to 
the database  run the client network utility 
cliconfg exe  which is located in the windows system 
folder on the client computer  add a server alias that 
specifies the remote server you need to connect to  and 
select tcpip as the default network library  
microsoft data engine rules for naming identifiers
you might see unexpected behavior if you are using a 
microsoft database engine msde database whose name does 
not conform to the following rules for identifiers 
  the first character must be one of the following 
 
 a letter as defined by the unicode standard    the 
 unicode definition of letters includes latin 
 characters az and az  in addition to letter 
 characters from other languages  
 the   underscore    at sign  or   number sign 
 symbol  certain symbols at the beginning of an 
 identifier have special meaning in msde  an identifier 
 beginning with   denotes a local variable or 
 parameter  an identifier beginning with   denotes a 
 temporary table or procedure  an identifier beginning 
 with double number signs    denotes a global 
 temporary object  
 some transactsql functions have names that start with 
 double at signs     to avoid confusion with these 
 functions  it is recommended that you do not use names 
 that start with     
  subsequent characters can be  
 letters as defined in the unicode standard    
 decimal numbers from either basic latin or other

multilingual issues
general
code page of client machine must match code page of 
server
for sql server international applications  you may see 
unexpected behavior if the system code page of client 
machines doesn t match the character set of microsoft sql 
server on the server  on the client  the system code page 
is the character set that is used by the language 
specified in operating system  if you are running windows 
nt workstation   or windows nt server    this is the 
default locale  on the server  the character set is 
specified during sql server installation  
in an access project   adp  result sets containing ansi 
text fields are not displayed correctly if the system 
code page of the client computer does not match the 
character set of the sql server to which the client is 
connected  this problem does not occur for data that is 
stored as unicode on the server  
create registry keys to temporarily enforce a code page 
during conversion
access normally uses the code page of the operating 
system to convert previousversion databases to access 
  if you are converting an access database in which 
the code page is different from that of the operating 
system on your computer  create a forcecp entry in the 
windows registry  

the forcecp registry entry temporarily enforces the code 
page that corresponds to the language you are using  the 
code page is the character set that is used by the 
language specified in the regional settings of the 
operating system  you might need to create a forcecp 
registry entry if you don t have the necessary language 
version of the operating system  or if the database is in 
a language for which the previous version of access had 
no sort order support  for example  previous versions of 
access did not support a sort order for vietnamese  
farsi  or a baltic languages estonian  latvian  or 
lithuanian  therefore  the sort order for databases in 
these languages was general  the forcecp registry entry 
allows nonwestern data in your tables to be converted 
correctly  warning  the forcecp registry entry affects 
only tables and queries  nonwestern characters in forms  
reports  macros  and modules might not be converted 
correctly if the code page of the access database doesn t 
match the code page specified by the operating system  
the full subkey you should add will be one of the 
following 
 hkey local machine software microsoft jet    engines jet x forcecp
 hkey local machine software microsoft jet    engines jet x forcecp
if you are converting a database that was created in 
access or later  create the new string value in the 
jet x subkey with the name  if you are converting a 
database that was created in access   or earlier  
create the new string value in the jet x subkey  in 
either case  the name of the entry is  forcecp   the 
value is the number of the code page that you want to 
use  for example  the number of the code page for windows 
baltic rim is  to allow the registry entry to take effect  quit 
access and restart it  after you have converted the 
access database  delete the registry entry so that 
access can resume its normal mode of operation for a more information about customizing windows registry 
settings for microsoft jet  type customize windows 
registry settings in the office assistant or on the 
answer wizard tab in the help window  and then click 
search  
error messages appear in wrong language when using 
language pack
if you are using the office language pack  error 
messages might appear in the wrong language  to ensure 
that error messages appear in the appropriate language  
first back up the u s  versions of the files msjint dll 
and mswstr dll that are located in your  windows system 
folder  then copy the localized versions of the files to 
your  windows system folder you can find localized versions of these files on the 
language pack cd in the following folder  
  extras jet  language 
where  language  is the threeletter abbreviation for the 
language that you are using key assignment macros in autokeys macro group no longer 
work
if you convert an access database that was created in 
german  spanish  brazilian  or portuguese versions of 
access  key assignment macros in the autokeys macro group 
might no longer work  in access sr  change the name of 
the autokeys macro group to the english word autokeys  
to enable the key assignment macros  this permits the key 
assignment macros in your database to work as expected in 
any language version of access sr  
message  database  msdb  cannot be opened 
you might receive the message  database  msdb  cannot be 
opened  when using database utilities  database security  
or replication in an access project that is connected to 
a microsoft data engine msde database  this message 
might occur if you selected a character set besides the

    to correct the problem with the msdb database 
  click the start button  point to programs  point to 
 msde  and click service manager   stop the msde service  
  click the start button  point to programs  and then 
 click msdos prompt   change to the  binn directory of msde  by default 
 this directory is c  mssql binn   type the following in the case shown 
 sqlservr c t
  repeat steps and    in the second msdos prompt window  type the 
 following in the case shown 
 osql usa p
 use msdb
 checkpoint

 note that the checkpoint command generates a warning 
 that the sort order in the database differs from the

 service cannot log on as  administrator  when modifying page 
connection string
in nonenglish versions of access  if you attempt to 
establish a connection between a database and a data 
access page  and you log on to the database with the user 
name  administrator   you receive the message  not a 
valid account name or password   to modify the connection 
string of a data access page  use the english word 
 admin  as the logon name nonu s   noneast asian  northwind sql project not 
advertised in the user interface
in nonu s  english and noneast asian versions of 
access  the northwind sql project file is not advertised 
in the user interface  you must run the office 
installation program or access sr installation program  
and change the installation setting of the northwind sql 
project file from  installed on first use  to  run from 
my computer  
hyperlink to database object doesn t work with object 
type name in local language
if you click a hyperlink whose subaddress specifies a 
database object  you might receive a message that access 
is not able to follow the hyperlink  this problem occurs 
if the object type string is in the local language 
instead of in english  for example  you might receive the 
message if the subaddress is   localizedreportstring 
 reportname   instead of the english string   report 
 reportname    when you create a hyperlink that points to 
a database object  you can prevent this message by 
clicking object in this database in the insert hyperlink 
or edit hyperlink dialog box  when you select an object 
from the list of objects in the database  access 
automatically creates a hyperlink whose object type 
string is in english righttoleft languages
printing in righttoleft languages
certain printers will require updated printer drivers  
please contact your printer manufacturer if you encounter 
problems printing expression builder limitations for righttoleft 
languages
you can enter and edit expressions directly in the 
properties window of controls or you can use the 
expression builder  if you have mixed righttoleft and 
latin text in your expressions  use the properties 
window  if you use the expression builder  your mixed
text expressions will be correctly transferred to the 
properties window  but the appearance of mixed text might 
be confusing hijri database calendar in sample applications
sample applications such as the northwind database expect 
the database calendar to be gregorian  because the 
sample application contains hardcoded date constants 
that are not valid hijri dates  running the sample 
application with the database calendar set to hijri 
tools startup use hijri calendar is not recommended input mask restrictions for righttoleft languages
input masks that you create for data entry will operate 
as expected only when latin text and numbers are entered  
righttoleft text entered in a field with an input mask 
will produce undesirable masked input behavior hijri calendar support in data access pages and web pages
all databound controls on data access pages and web 
pages can display date values in gregorian calendar 
format  date display in hijri calendar format is also 
possible if certain controls are used  
  office web controls webcalc  pivotlist and webchart 
 support date display in hijri calendar format  the 
 calendar used for date display is determined by the 
 calendar type setting on the date tab of the regional 
 settings properties dialog box available through 
 windows control panel   most other controls used for data binding  such as the 
 intrinsic textbox and label controls of internet 
 explorer   display date values only in gregorian 
 calendar format viewing arabic data in microsoft replication conflict 
viewer and importexport wizards
to view sample information and certain other arabic data 
correctly when running the microsoft replication conflict 
viewer and the importexport wizards  the locale setting 
on the regional settings tab of the regional settings 
dialog box available through the windows control panel 
must be arabic saudi arabia  
east asian languages
possible display problems when using multiple asian fonts
if you install multiple asian fonts on nonasian versions 
of microsoft windows nt server   or microsoft windows 
nt workstation    you might experience display 
problems  such as very large text  blank text  or very 
large blank areas occurring in access sr or in windows

installing access sr on a network
    to create an administrative installation point for 
access sr 
  create a share on a network server for the 
 administrative installation point  the network share 
 must have at least megabytes mb of available 
 disk space  
  on a computer that is running microsoft windows  
 windows nt workstation or windows nt server and that 
 has write permission to the share  connect to the 
 server share  
  on the start menu  click run  and then click browse  
  on office disc in the cdrom drive  select setup exe 
 and click open  
  on the command line following setup exe  type 
 a data msi 
 and click ok  
 for example  
 e  setup exe a data msi 
  when prompted  enter the organization name that you 
 want to define for all users who install office from 
 this location  
  when prompted for the installation location  enter the 
 server and share you created  
for more information about network and administration 
issues  see the office resource kit web site at  
http www microsoft comofficeork
prompt for cd key when installing from an administrative 
installation 
when you install access sr on your computer from an 
administrative installation on a server  you might be 
prompted for a cd key  this occurs if the system 
administrator who created the administrative 
installation did not enter the cd key to solve this problem  ask the system administrator to 
create a new administrative installation and enter the cd 
key in the first dialog box  after this has been done  
you will not be prompted for the cd key when you install 
access sr from this new administrative installation  
message  file already in use  when running access sr 
from a network
if you are running access sr from the network  you 
might receive the following message when you open an 
access database 
 could not use  admin   file already in use this message occurs when a user who has write permissions 
to the network share opens an access database  subsequent 
users who have only read permissions to that share 
receive the message when they attempt to open an access 
database  
after you have run the administrative installation of 
office or access sr  you can prevent this message 
by setting the effective sharelevel permissions to read 
permissions for all users who will run access sr from 
the network server  if you are an administrator  you 
might want to create a separate share to the same folder  
and give any administrators full control permissions so 
that they can maintain the files in this folder  however  
all users should install office or access sr from 
the share with read permissions  
installing access sr over an access runtime 
application
if you are upgrading from access or office on a
computer where you have installed an access runtime 
application  the default installation location for office 
 or access sr is 
 c  program files officek
installing office or access sr to this alternate 
default location ensures that you keep the access 
version of msaccess exe if it is needed by the runtime 
application unexpected message during installation
if you get an unexpected message during the installation 
of office  and you get the same message when you try to 
install office again  you can create a log file that will 
be useful to microsoft product support services in 
troubleshooting the problem  once you create the file  
you will need to call microsoft product support services     to create the log file 
 
  click the start button on the taskbar  and then click 
 run   in the open box  type  
 
  path  setup exe l v c  verboselog txt
 
 where  path  is the location of setup exe  for 
 example  if you are installing from a cdrom drive  
 then the text you would type might look like 
  d  setup exe l v c  verboselog txt
   click ok  
setup will start again and a log file called 
verboselog txt will be created at the root of your c  
drive installing access sr without removing the beta build 
of office 
when starting access sr  you might receive the 
following message  
 required registry information is missing and this 
 application cannot run  please rerun setup to correct 
 this problem  
or  after a few seconds  the program might quit  
you might experience either of the above if you installed 
access sr without removing the beta build b of 
microsoft office      to solve this problem  do the following to remove the 
beta build of office  
  click the start button on the taskbar  point to 
 settings  and click control panel   doubleclick the addremove programs icon   in the list of installed programs  click microsoft 
 office premium edition  this is the beta 
 version of office    click addremove   click remove office   click yes to the prompt confirming that you want to 
 remove access sr shortcut on the programs menu varies 
according to your operating system 
the access sr shortcut on the programs menu might have 
the following problems  
  it does not selfrepair the program  
 this problem occurs because your operating system does 
 not support windows installer shortcuts  only the 
 following versions of microsoft windows support these 
 shortcuts  
   windows 
   windows with internet explorer    service 
 pack and active desktop installed
   microsoft windows nt version with 
 internet explorer    service pack   and 
 active desktop installed  
 note  if you install internet explorer on a computer 
 that has windows or windows nt version with 
 internet explorer    service pack   and active 
 desktop installed  it will still support windows 
 installer shortcuts  
  it does not install the program on first use  
 this problem occurs because installed on first use is 
 not an option for access in the selecting features 
 dialog box during setup  installed on first use is not 
 an option because your operating system does not 
 support windows installer shortcuts  the operating 
 systems listed under   support windows installer 
 shortcuts  
  it does not display a path on the shortcut tab of the 
 properties dialog box for the shortcut  
 this indicates that the shortcut is a windows 
 installer shortcut  windows installer shortcuts do not 
 directly reference the path of the shortcut target  
 instead  they contain a token that the windows 
 installer resolves to the path of the shortcut 
 target  the operating systems listed under item 
 support windows installer shortcuts working with access sr displaying dates with fourdigit years 
in access sr  you can specify that date fields and 
controls display fourdigit years  this helps you to 
ensure that the century of a particular date is correct  
on the general tab of the options dialog box tools 
menu  under use fourdigit year formatting  you can do 
one of the following 
  select the this database check box to display four
 digit years at the database level in the current 
 access database or access project 
  select the all databases check box to display four
 digit years at the application level in all access 
 databases and access projects selecting one of these check boxes only changes how dates 
are displayedit does not change the data itself  these 
options override format property settings for individual 
fields and controls euro symbol not printed correctly 
although the euro symbol might be displayed correctly in 
print preview  it might not print correctly  for example  
it might not appear at all in the printout  or it might
appear as another character  
this behavior can occur if you are using a printer font 
that does not support the euro  to resolve this problem  
first try using a true type font that does support the 
euro  such as arial  courier new  or times new roman  if 
the euro symbol still isn t printed correctly  change the 
spool data format for your printer from emf to raw  
    to change the spool data format for your printer from 
emf to raw 
  click the start button  point to settings  and then 
 click printers   in the printers dialog box  rightclick your printer  
 and then click properties   in the  printer  properties dialog box  click the 
 details tab  and then click spool settings   in the spool data format box  change the setting from 
 emf to raw for more information  contact your printer vendor maximum number of levels of nested forms or reports
the maximum number of nested forms or reports is seven  out of memory  message on windows nt server   or 
windows nt workstation  you might receive an  out of memory  message when you 
attempt to save or close a large access database or 
access project on windows nt workstation   or windows

or use a tooltip in a rectangle  it might not be 
displayed correctly  to ensure that the control or 
tooltip is displayed correctly  open the form or data 
access page in design view  click the rectangle  and then 
click send to back on the format menu using the image control in a data access page
in access sr  you cannot bind an image control in a 
data access page to an ole object field in an underlying 
table  however  you can use an image control in a data 
access page to display a different picture for each 
record  in the table  create a text field that contains 
the urls of the pictures  then in the data access page 
based on the table  add an unbound image control  and set 
its controlsource property to that field print commands unavailable when data access page is

problems when using taskbar buttons to navigate between 
multiple data access pages
if you have installed the active desktop  and in internet 
explorer you have cleared the check box to launch 
browser windows in a separate process  you might 
experience problems if you open multiple data access 
pages and move between them by clicking their 
corresponding taskbar buttons  for example  if you open 
one data access page and you then open a second data 
access page in another window  in some cases you might 
not be able to navigate back to the first page until you 
have closed the second page  to prevent this behavior  
start internet explorer  click internet options on the 
tools menu  and on the advanced tab  select the check box 
to launch browser windows in a separate process  
display problems when scrolling through the employees 
form in northwind
in the northwind sample database  the display might 
flicker when you scroll through the records in the 
employees form  
    to prevent this problem  
  in windows control panel  doubleclick the display 
 icon  and then click the settings tab   in the color palette box  click a setting with more 
 than colors  note  if your system does not support more than 
 colors  you will not be able to select a higher 
 setting using northwind sample database located on a readonly 
share
if you open a copy of the northwind sample database that 
is located on a readonly share  you might receive the 
following message 
 there were errors fixing your data access page 
 connections  some pages may not function as expected when you first open the northwind sample database  it 
attempts to fix the connections of its data access pages  
this process checks the file attribute of northwind  if 
the attribute is readonly  the process cannot fix the 
connections  and execution stops without error  however  
the fixup process does not check the permissions of the 
network share where northwind is located  if the share is 
readonly  the connections cannot be fixed  
this behavior may occur in any database containing 
similar code that fixes data access page connections  if 
you are deploying northwind or any database with a 
similar fixup process on a readonly share  you can avoid 
this problem by setting the file attribute of the 
database to readonly  you can also prevent the fixup 
process from running by pressing the shift key while you 
open the northwind sample database  however  this might 
mean that the data access pages will not function as 
expected

against sql server 
you must install office sr or access sr 
updates or better to test your access adp applications against 
sql server   the officeaccess sr updates allow you
to design database diagrams  tables  and views  but do not 
allow you to save your changes  this is due to the metadata 
changes happened between sql server   and sql server   
the sr update also fixes the ability for access forms and 
reports to run against stored procedures  sr supports the 
design and saving of stored procedures future updates of office and access available after 
sql server ships will allow limited design and saving of 
database diagrams  tables  and views                                                          
microsoft jet
ansi compliant sql
the microsoft jet   database engine supports two forms 
of sql syntax  one mode supports the same jet sql 
commands used in previous versions of access  and another 
new mode supports new jet sql commands and syntax that 
are more compliant with the ansi sql standard  the 
mode that supports the sql commands used in previous 
versions of access is the only mode that is available 
through the access sr user interface  the newer sql 
syntax is currently available only in visual basic for 
applications vba procedures that use activex data 
objects ado and the microsoft ole db provider for jet 
version  x  when you use the ole db provider for jet 
version  x through ado  you can execute temporary 
queries i e   queries that are not stored and are used 
as part of a recordset s source by using 
connection execute or command execute or create stored 
queries by using the new create view  create procedure 
syntax  
although you can use ado and the ole db provider for jet 
 x to access all stored queries created through the ole 
db provider for jet  x  they are not visible in the 
access user interface  for example  you cannot set the 
recordsource property of a form to a query created with 
the microsoft activex data objects extensions for ddl and 
security adox version   object library  and you 
cannot import a query created with adox into another 
database  however  you can still use ado code to run 
stored queries created by using adox if you try to save a new query and receive a message that 
the name you entered already exists for another object  
try using a different name  an ansi query with the 
same name might already exist  but might not be visible 
in the objects list in the database window  
for more information about ansi compliant sql with the 
microsoft ole db provider for jet version  x  type 
comparison of jet sql and ansi sql in the office 
assistant or on the answer wizard tab in the help window  
and then click search

conversion and compatibility
compatibility library
access sr does not ship with the dao   x 
compatibility library  if you attempt to convert an 
access database in which the code contains older versions 
of dao objects  methods  and properties that depend on 
the dao   x compatibility library  you might receive 
a message that there were compilation errors during the 
conversion of the database  if the dao   x 
compatibility library that shipped with a previous 
version of access still exists on your computer  you can 
create a reference to it and then use it  however  before 
you convert an access database on a computer where the 
dao   x compatibility library does not exist  you 
must update the code so that it does not depend on 
that library  
turning on name autocorrect in a converted access 
database
by default  name autocorrect is not turned on in a 
converted access database  to turn on name autocorrect  
click options on the tools menu  click the general tab  
and under name autocorrect  select the appropriate check 
boxes  then open each table  query  form  and report in 
design view  save the object  and close it for more information  type name autocorrect in the 
office assistant or on the answer wizard tab in the help

microsoft access projects 
unexpected behavior when sql statement output contains 
two fields with same name
in an access project   adp  you might see unexpected 
results when you use an sql statement whose output 
contains two or more fields with the same name  for 
example  you might see unexpected behavior when you 
work with a view that is based on two tables and that 
contains two fields that have the same name but are 
located in different tables  to prevent unexpected 
behavior  specify an alias for one of the fields to 
ensure that every field in the output has a unique name  
can t refer to controls in forms or reports in aggregate 
functions
in an access project  your aggregate functions cannot use 
references to controls in objects such as forms or 
reports  for example  you cannot use the following 
expression 
  dlookup categoryname   categories   categoryid   
 reports report categoryid 
rebooting your computer after installing microsoft data 
engine msde
to ensure that microsoft data engine msde runs 
correctly  you must reboot your computer after installing 
msde  if you do not reboot your computer  you might see 
unexpected behavior while using msde  for example  if you 
attempt to create a new publication from an access 
project  you might receive a message that one of the 
library files needed to run this application cannot be 
found error   for more information about msde  type 
work with a microsoft access project in the office 
assistant or on the answer wizard tab in the help window  
and then click search  order by clause may not be used in this query type  when 
view has top clause
when you save a view that contains a top clause and an 
order by clause  you might receive the message  order by 
clause may not be used in this query type   however  when 
you run the query  it returns the correct results and no 
message appears incoming named pipe connections not supported on windows 
 or windows 
you cannot connect to a remote microsoft data engine 
msde or sql server   desktop database located on a 
windows or windows computer unless you use a 
protocol other than named pipes  these platforms do not 
support incoming named pipe connections  to connect to 
the database  run the client network utility 
cliconfg exe  which is located in the windows system 
folder on the client computer  add a server alias that 
specifies the remote server you need to connect to  and 
select tcpip as the default network library  
microsoft data engine rules for naming identifiers
you might see unexpected behavior if you are using a 
microsoft database engine msde database whose name does 
not conform to the following rules for identifiers 
  the first character must be one of the following 
 
 a letter as defined by the unicode standard    the 
 unicode definition of letters includes latin 
 characters az and az  in addition to letter 
 characters from other languages  
 the   underscore    at sign  or   number sign 
 symbol  certain symbols at the beginning of an 
 identifier have special meaning in msde  an identifier 
 beginning with   denotes a local variable or 
 parameter  an identifier beginning with   denotes a 
 temporary table or procedure  an identifier beginning 
 with double number signs    denotes a global 
 temporary object  
 some transactsql functions have names that start with 
 double at signs     to avoid confusion with these 
 functions  it is recommended that you do not use names 
 that start with     
  subsequent characters can be  
 letters as defined in the unicode standard    
 decimal numbers from either basic latin or other 
 national scripts  
 the          or   symbols  
 the identifier must not be a transactsql reserved 
 word  
 msde reserves both the uppercase and lowercase 
 versions of reserved words  
  embedded spaces or special characters are not allowed

multilingual issues
general
code page of client machine must match code page of 
server
for sql server international applications  you may see 
unexpected behavior if the system code page of client 
machines doesn t match the character set of microsoft sql 
server on the server  on the client  the system code page 
is the character set that is used by the language 
specified in operating system  if you are running windows 
nt workstation   or windows nt server    this is the 
default locale  on the server  the character set is 
specified during sql server installation  
in an access project   adp  result sets containing ansi 
text fields are not displayed correctly if the system 
code page of the client computer does not match the 
character set of the sql server to which the client is 
connected  this problem does not occur for data that is 
stored as unicode on the server  
create registry keys to temporarily enforce a code page 
during conversion
access normally uses the code page of the operating 
system to convert previousversion databases to access 
  if you are converting an access database in which 
the code page is different from that of the operating 
system on your computer  create a forcecp entry in the 
windows registry  

the forcecp registry entry temporarily enforces the code 
page that corresponds to the language you are using  the 
code page is the character set that is used by the 
language specified in the regional settings of the 
operating system  you might need to create a forcecp 
registry entry if you don t have the necessary language 
version of the operating system  or if the database is in 
a language for which the previous version of access had 
no sort order support  for example  previous versions of 
access did not support a sort order for vietnamese  
farsi  or a baltic languages estonian  latvian  or 
lithuanian  therefore  the sort order for databases in 
these languages was general  the forcecp registry entry 
allows nonwestern data in your tables to be converted 
correctly  warning  the forcecp registry entry affects 
only tables and queries  nonwestern characters in forms  
reports  macros  and modules might not be converted 
correctly if the code page of the access database doesn t 
match the code page specified by the operating system  
the full subkey you should add will be one of the 
following 
 hkey local machine software microsoft jet    engines jet x forcecp
 hkey local machine software microsoft jet    engines jet x forcecp
if you are converting a database that was created in 
access or later  create the new string value in the 
jet x subkey with the name  if you are converting a 
database that was created in access   or earlier  
create the new string value in the jet x subkey  in 
either case  the name of the entry is  forcecp   the 
value is the number of the code page that you want to 
use  for example  the number of the code page for windows 
baltic rim is  to allow the registry entry to take effect  quit 
access and restart it  after you have converted the 
access database  delete the registry entry so that 
access can resume its normal mode of operation for a more information about customizing windows registry 
settings for microsoft jet  type customize windows 
registry settings in the office assistant or on the 
answer wizard tab in the help window  and then click 
search  
error messages appear in wrong language when using 
language pack
if you are using the office language pack  error 
messages might appear in the wrong language  to ensure 
that error messages appear in the appropriate language  
first back up the u s  versions of the files msjint dll 
and mswstr dll that are located in your  windows system 
folder  then copy the localized versions of the files to 
your  windows system folder you can find localized versions of these files on the 
language pack cd in the following folder  
  extras jet  language 
where  language  is the threeletter abbreviation for the 
language that you are using key assignment macros in autokeys macro group no longer 
work
if you convert an access database that was created in 
german  spanish  brazilian  or portuguese versions of 
access  key assignment macros in the autokeys macro group 
might no longer work  in access sr  change the name of 
the autokeys macro group to the english word autokeys  
to enable the key assignment macros  this permits the key 
assignment macros in your database to work as expected in 
any language version of access sr  
message  database  msdb  cannot be opened 
you might receive the message  database  msdb  cannot be 
opened  when using database utilities  database security  
or replication in an access project that is connected to 
a microsoft data engine msde database  this message 
might occur if you selected a character set besides the 
default iso character set in the character setsort 
orderunicode collation dialog box during msde 
installation  and you also accepted the other default

unicode  the casesensitive  widthinsensitive and kana
insensitive check boxes are selected by default  
    to correct the problem with the msdb database 
  click the start button  point to programs  point to 
 msde  and click service manager   stop the msde service  
  click the start button  point to programs  and then 
 click msdos prompt   change to the  binn directory of msde  by default 
 this directory is c  mssql binn   type the following in the case shown 
 sqlservr c t
  repeat steps and    in the second msdos prompt window  type the 
 following in the case shown 
 osql usa p
 use msdb
 checkpoint
 go
 shutdown

 note that the checkpoint command generates a warning 
 that the sort order in the database differs from the

 service cannot log on as  administrator  when modifying page 
connection string
in nonenglish versions of access  if you attempt to 
establish a connection between a database and a data 
access page  and you log on to the database with the user 
name  administrator   you receive the message  not a 
valid account name or password   to modify the connection 
string of a data access page  use the english word 
 admin  as the logon name nonu s   noneast asian  northwind sql project not 
advertised in the user interface
in nonu s  english and noneast asian versions of 
access  the northwind sql project file is not advertised 
in the user interface  you must run the office 
installation program or access sr installation program  
and change the installation setting of the northwind sql 
project file from  installed on first use  to  run from 
my computer  
hyperlink to database object doesn t work with object 
type name in local language
if you click a hyperlink whose subaddress specifies a 
database object  you might receive a message that access 
is not able to follow the hyperlink  this problem occurs 
if the object type string is in the local language 
instead of in english  for example  you might receive the 
message if the subaddress is   localizedreportstring 
 reportname   instead of the english string   report 
 reportname    when you create a hyperlink that points to 
a database object  you can prevent this message by 
clicking object in this database in the insert hyperlink 
or edit hyperlink dialog box  when you select an object 
from the list of objects in the database  access 
automatically creates a hyperlink whose object type 
string is in english righttoleft languages
printing in righttoleft languages
certain printers will require updated printer drivers  
please contact your printer manufacturer if you encounter 
problems printing expression builder limitations for righttoleft 
languages
you can enter and edit expressions directly in the 
properties window of controls or you can use the 
expression builder  if you have mixed righttoleft and 
latin text in your expressions  use the properties 
window  if you use the expression builder  your mixed
text expressions will be correctly transferred to the 
properties window  but the appearance of mixed text might 
be confusing hijri database calendar in sample applications
sample applications such as the northwind database expect 
the database calendar to be gregorian  because the 
sample application contains hardcoded date constants 
that are not valid hijri dates  running the sample 
application with the database calendar set to hijri 
tools startup use hijri calendar is not recommended input mask restrictions for righttoleft languages
input masks that you create for data entry will operate 
as expected only when latin text and numbers are entered  
righttoleft text entered in a field with an input mask 
will produce undesirable masked input behavior hijri calendar support in data access pages and web pages
all databound controls on data access pages and web 
pages can display date values in gregorian calendar 
format  date display in hijri calendar format is also 
possible if certain controls are used  
  office web controls webcalc  pivotlist and webchart 
 support date display in hijri calendar format  the 
 calendar used for date display is determined by the 
 calendar type setting on the date tab of the regional 
 settings properties dialog box available through 
 windows control panel   most other controls used for data binding  such as the 
 intrinsic textbox and label controls of internet 
 explorer   display date values only in gregorian 
 calendar format viewing arabic data in microsoft replication conflict 
viewer and importexport wizards
to view sample information and certain other arabic data 
correctly when running the microsoft replication conflict 
viewer and the importexport wizards  the locale setting 
on the regional settings tab of the regional settings 
dialog box available through the windows control panel 
must be arabic saudi arabia  
east asian languages
possible display problems when using multiple asian fonts
if you install multiple asian fonts on nonasian versions 
of microsoft windows nt server   or microsoft windows 
nt workstation    you might experience display 
problems  such as very large text  blank text  or very 
large blank areas occurring in access sr or in windows

installing access sr on a network
    to create an administrative installation point for 
access sr 
  create a share on a network server for the 
 administrative installation point  the network share 
 must have at least megabytes mb of available

issues  see the office resource kit web site at  
http www microsoft comofficeork
prompt for cd key when installing from an administrative 
installation 
when you install access sr on your computer from an 
administrative installation on a server  you might be 
prompted for a cd key  this occurs if the system 
administrator who created the administrative 
installation did not enter the cd key to solve this problem  ask the system administrator to 
create a new administrative installation and enter the cd 
key in the first dialog box  after this has been done  
you will not be prompted for the cd key when you install 
access sr from this new administrative installation  
message  file already in use  when running access sr 
from a network
if you are running access sr from the network  you 
might receive the following message when you open an 
access database 
 could not use  admin   file already in use this message occurs when a user who has write permissions 
to the network share opens an access database  subsequent 
users who have only read permissions to that share 
receive the message when they attempt to open an access 
database  
after you have run the administrative installation of 
office or access sr  you can prevent this message 
by setting the effective sharelevel permissions to read 
permissions for all users who will run access sr from 
the network server  if you are an administrator  you 
might want to create a separate share to the same folder  
and give any administrators full control permissions so 
that they can maintain the files in this folder  however  
all users should install office or access sr from 
the share with read permissions  
installing access sr over an access runtime 
application
if you are upgrading from access or office on a
computer where you have installed an access runtime 
application  the default installation location for office 
 or access sr is 
 c  program files officek
installing office or access sr to this alternate 
default location ensures that you keep the access 
version of msaccess exe if it is needed by the runtime 
application unexpected message during installation
if you get an unexpected message during the installation 
of office  and you get the same message when you try to 
install office again  you can create a log file that will 
be useful to microsoft product support services in 
troubleshooting the problem  once you create the file  
you will need to call microsoft product support services     to create the log file 
 
  click the start button on the taskbar  and then click 
 run   in the open box  type  
 
  path  setup exe l v c  verboselog txt
 
 where  path  is the location of setup exe  for 
 example  if you are installing from a cdrom drive  
 then the text you would type might look like 
  d  setup exe l v c  verboselog txt
   click ok  
setup will start again and a log file called 
verboselog txt will be created at the root of your c  
drive installing access sr without removing the beta build 
of office 
when starting access sr  you might receive the 
following message  
 required registry information is missing and this 
 application cannot run  please rerun setup to correct 
 this problem  
or  after a few seconds  the program might quit  
you might experience either of the above if you installed 
access sr without removing the beta build b of 
microsoft office      to solve this problem  do the following to remove the 
beta build of office  
  click the start button on the taskbar  point to 
 settings  and click control panel   doubleclick the addremove programs icon   in the list of installed programs  click microsoft 
 office premium edition  this is the beta 
 version of office    click addremove   click remove office   click yes to the prompt confirming that you want to 
 remove access sr shortcut on the programs menu varies 
according to your operating system 
the access sr shortcut on the programs menu might have 
the following problems  
  it does not selfrepair the program  
 this problem occurs because your operating system does 
 not support windows installer shortcuts  only the 
 following versions of microsoft windows support these 
 shortcuts  
   windows 
   windows with internet explorer    service 
 pack and active desktop installed
   microsoft windows nt version with 
 internet explorer    service pack   and 
 active desktop installed  
 note  if you install internet explorer on a computer 
 that has windows or windows nt version with 
 internet explorer    service pack   and active 
 desktop installed  it will still support windows 
 installer shortcuts  
  it does not install the program on first use  
 this problem occurs because installed on first use is 
 not an option for access in the selecting features 
 dialog box during setup  installed on first use is not 
 an option because your operating system does not 
 support windows installer shortcuts  the operating 
 systems listed under   support windows installer 
 shortcuts  
  it does not display a path on the shortcut tab of the 
 properties dialog box for the shortcut  
 this indicates that the shortcut is a windows 
 installer shortcut  windows installer shortcuts do not 
 directly reference the path of the shortcut target  
 instead  they contain a token that the windows 
 installer resolves to the path of the shortcut 
 target  the operating systems listed under item 
 support windows installer shortcuts working with access sr displaying dates with fourdigit years 
in access sr  you can specify that date fields and 
controls display fourdigit years  this helps you to 
ensure that the century of a particular date is correct  
on the general tab of the options dialog box tools 
menu  under use fourdigit year formatting  you can do 
one of the following 
  select the this database check box to display four
 digit years at the database level in the current 
 access database or access project 
  select the all databases check box to display four
 digit years at the application level in all access 
 databases and access projects selecting one of these check boxes only changes how dates 
are displayedit does not change the data itself  these 
options override format property settings for individual 
fields and controls euro symbol not printed correctly 
although the euro symbol might be displayed correctly in 
print preview  it might not print correctly  for example  
it might not appear at all in the printout  or it might
appear as another character  
this behavior can occur if you are using a printer font 
that does not support the euro  to resolve this problem  
first try using a true type font that does support the 
euro  such as arial  courier new  or times new roman  if 
the euro symbol still isn t printed correctly  change the 
spool data format for your printer from emf to raw

problems when using taskbar buttons to navigate between 
multiple data access pages
if you have installed the active desktop  and in internet 
explorer you have cleared the check box to launch 
browser windows in a separate process  you might 
experience problems if you open multiple data access 
pages and move between them by clicking their 
corresponding taskbar buttons  for example  if you open 
one data access page and you then open a second data 
access page in another window  in some cases you might 
not be able to navigate back to the first page until you 
have closed the second page  to prevent this behavior  
start internet explorer  click internet options on the 
tools menu  and on the advanced tab  select the check box 
to launch browser windows in a separate process  
display problems when scrolling through the employees 
form in northwind
in the northwind sample database  the display might 
flicker when you scroll through the records in the 
employees form  
    to prevent this problem  
  in windows control panel  doubleclick the display 
 icon  and then click the settings tab   in the color palette box  click a setting with more 
 than colors  note  if your system does not support more than 
 colors  you will not be able to select a higher 
 setting using northwind sample database located on a readonly 
share
if you open a copy of the northwind sample database that 
is located on a readonly share  you might receive the 
following message 
 there were errors fixing your data access page 
 connections  some pages may not function as expected when you first open the northwind sample database  it 
attempts to fix the connections of its data access pages  
this process checks the file attribute of northwind  if 
the attribute is readonly  the process cannot fix the 
connections  and execution stops without error  however  
the fixup process does not check the permissions of the 
network share where northwind is located  if the share is 
readonly  the connections cannot be fixed  
this behavior may occur in any database containing 
similar code that fixes data access page connections  if 
you are deploying northwind or any database with a 
similar fixup process on a readonly share  you can avoid 
this problem by setting the file attribute of the 
database to readonly  you can also prevent the fixup 
process from running by pressing the shift key while you 
open the northwind sample database  however  this might 
mean that the data access pages will not function as 
expected

against sql server 
you must install office sr or access sr 
updates or better to test your access adp applications against 
sql server   the officeaccess sr updates allow you
to design database diagrams  tables  and views  but do not 
allow you to save your changes  this is due to the metadata 
changes happened between sql server   and sql server   
the sr update also fixes the ability for access forms and 
reports to run against stored procedures  sr supports the 
design and saving of stored procedures future updates of office and access available after 
sql server ships will allow limited design and saving of 
database diagrams  tables  and views                                                          
microsoft jet
ansi compliant sql
the microsoft jet   database engine supports two forms 
of sql syntax  one mode supports the same jet sql 
commands used in previous versions of access  and another 
new mode supports new jet sql commands and syntax that 
are more compliant with the ansi sql standard  the 
mode that supports the sql commands used in previous 
versions of access is the only mode that is available 
through the access sr user interface  the newer sql 
syntax is currently available only in visual basic for 
applications vba procedures that use activex data 
objects ado and the microsoft ole db provider for jet 
version  x  when you use the ole db provider for jet 
version  x through ado  you can execute temporary 
queries i e   queries that are not stored and are used 
as part of a recordset s source by using 
connection execute or command execute or create stored 
queries by using the new create view  create procedure 
syntax  
although you can use ado and the ole db provider for jet 
 x to access all stored queries created through the ole 
db provider for jet  x  they are not visible in the 
access user interface  for example  you cannot set the 
recordsource property of a form to a query created with 
the microsoft activex data objects extensions for ddl and 
security adox version   object library  and you 
cannot import a query created with adox into another 
database  however  you can still use ado code to run 
stored queries created by using adox if you try to save a new query and receive a message that 
the name you entered already exists for another object  
try using a different name  an ansi query with the 
same name might already exist  but might not be visible 
in the objects list in the database window  
for more information about ansi compliant sql with the 
microsoft ole db provider for jet version  x  type 
comparison of jet sql and ansi sql in the office 
assistant or on the answer wizard tab in the help window  
and then click search  
counter and identity 
counter and identity are microsoft jet sql reserved 
words  but they are not jet sql data types  for more 
information about the microsoft jet data types  see the 
microsoft jet database engine programmer s guide

conversion and compatibility
compatibility library
access sr does not ship with the dao   x 
compatibility library  if you attempt to convert an 
access database in which the code contains older versions 
of dao objects  methods  and properties that depend on 
the dao   x compatibility library  you might receive 
a message that there were compilation errors during the 
conversion of the database  if the dao   x 
compatibility library that shipped with a previous 
version of access still exists on your computer  you can 
create a reference to it and then use it  however  before 
you convert an access database on a computer where the 
dao   x compatibility library does not exist  you 
must update the code so that it does not depend on 
that library  
turning on name autocorrect in a converted access 
database
by default  name autocorrect is not turned on in a 
converted access database  to turn on name autocorrect  
click options on the tools menu  click the general tab  
and under name autocorrect  select the appropriate check 
boxes  then open each table  query  form  and report in 
design view  save the object  and close it for more information  type name autocorrect in the 
office assistant or on the answer wizard tab in the help

microsoft access projects 
unexpected behavior when sql statement output contains 
two fields with same name
in an access project   adp  you might see unexpected 
results when you use an sql statement whose output 
contains two or more fields with the same name  for 
example  you might see unexpected behavior when you 
work with a view that is based on two tables and that 
contains two fields that have the same name but are 
located in different tables  to prevent unexpected 
behavior  specify an alias for one of the fields to 
ensure that every field in the output has a unique name  
can t refer to controls in forms or reports in aggregate 
functions
in an access project  your aggregate functions cannot use 
references to controls in objects such as forms or 
reports  for example  you cannot use the following 
expression 
  dlookup categoryname   categories   categoryid   
 reports report categoryid 
rebooting your computer after installing microsoft data 
engine msde
to ensure that microsoft data engine msde runs 
correctly  you must reboot your computer after installing 
msde  if you do not reboot your computer  you might see 
unexpected behavior while using msde  for example  if you 
attempt to create a new publication from an access 
project  you might receive a message that one of the 
library files needed to run this application cannot be 
found error   for more information about msde  type 
work with a microsoft access project in the office 
assistant or on the answer wizard tab in the help window  
and then click search  order by clause may not be used in this query type  when 
view has top clause
when you save a view that contains a top clause and an 
order by clause  you might receive the message  order by 
clause may not be used in this query type   however  when 
you run the query  it returns the correct results and no 
message appears incoming named pipe connections not supported on windows 
 or windows 
you cannot connect to a remote microsoft data engine 
msde or sql server   desktop database located on a 
windows or windows computer unless you use a 
protocol other than named pipes  these platforms do not 
support incoming named pipe connections  to connect to 
the database  run the client network utility 
cliconfg exe  which is located in the windows system 
folder on the client computer  add a server alias that 
specifies the remote server you need to connect to  and 
select tcpip as the default network library  
microsoft data engine rules for naming identifiers
you might see unexpected behavior if you are using a 
microsoft database engine msde database whose name does 
not conform to the following rules for identifiers 
  the first character must be one of the following 
 
 a letter as defined by the unicode standard    the 
 unicode definition of letters includes latin 
 characters az and az  in addition to letter 
 characters from other languages  
 the   underscore    at sign  or   number sign 
 symbol  certain symbols at the beginning of an 
 identifier have special meaning in msde  an identifier 
 beginning with   denotes a local variable or 
 parameter  an identifier beginning with   denotes a 
 temporary table or procedure  an identifier beginning 
 with double number signs    denotes a global 
 temporary object  
 some transactsql functions have names that start with 
 double at signs     to avoid confusion with these 
 functions  it is recommended that you do not use names 
 that start with     
  subsequent characters can be  
 letters as defined in the unicode standard    
 decimal numbers from either basic latin or other 
 national scripts  
 the          or   symbols  
 the identifier must not be a transactsql reserved 
 word  
 msde reserves both the uppercase and lowercase 
 versions of reserved words  
  embedded spaces or special characters are not allowed

multilingual issues
general
code page of client machine must match code page of 
server
for sql server international applications  you may see 
unexpected behavior if the system code page of client 
machines doesn t match the character set of microsoft sql 
server on the server  on the client  the system code page 
is the character set that is used by the language 
specified in operating system  if you are running windows 
nt workstation   or windows nt server    this is the 
default locale  on the server  the character set is 
specified during sql server installation  
in an access project   adp  result sets containing ansi 
text fields are not displayed correctly if the system 
code page of the client computer does not match the 
character set of the sql server to which the client is 
connected  this problem does not occur for data that is 
stored as unicode on the server  
create registry keys to temporarily enforce a code page 
during conversion
access normally uses the code page of the operating 
system to convert previousversion databases to access 
  if you are converting an access database in which 
the code page is different from that of the operating 
system on your computer  create a forcecp entry in the 
windows registry  

the forcecp registry entry temporarily enforces the code 
page that corresponds to the language you are using  the 
code page is the character set that is used by the 
language specified in the regional settings of the 
operating system  you might need to create a forcecp 
registry entry if you don t have the necessary language 
version of the operating system  or if the database is in 
a language for which the previous version of access had 
no sort order support  for example  previous versions of 
access did not support a sort order for vietnamese  
farsi  or a baltic languages estonian  latvian  or 
lithuanian  therefore  the sort order for databases in 
these languages was general  the forcecp registry entry 
allows nonwestern data in your tables to be converted 
correctly  warning  the forcecp registry entry affects 
only tables and queries  nonwestern characters in forms  
reports  macros  and modules might not be converted 
correctly if the code page of the access database doesn t 
match the code page specified by the operating system  
the full subkey you should add will be one of the 
following 
 hkey local machine software microsoft jet    engines jet x forcecp
 hkey local machine software microsoft jet    engines jet x forcecp
if you are converting a database that was created in 
access or later  create the new string value in the 
jet x subkey with the name  if you are converting a 
database that was created in access   or earlier  
create the new string value in the jet x subkey  in 
either case  the name of the entry is  forcecp   the 
value is the number of the code page that you want to 
use  for example  the number of the code page for windows 
baltic rim is  to allow the registry entry to take effect  quit 
access and restart it  after you have converted the 
access database  delete the registry entry so that 
access can resume its normal mode of operation for a more information about customizing windows registry 
settings for microsoft jet  type customize windows 
registry settings in the office assistant or on the 
answer wizard tab in the help window  and then click 
search  
error messages appear in wrong language when using 
language pack
if you are using the office language pack  error 
messages might appear in the wrong language  to ensure 
that error messages appear in the appropriate language  
first back up the u s  versions of the files msjint dll 
and mswstr dll that are located in your  windows system 
folder  then copy the localized versions of the files to 
your  windows system folder you can find localized versions of these files on the 
language pack cd in the following folder  
  extras jet  language 
where  language  is the threeletter abbreviation for the 
language that you are using key assignment macros in autokeys macro group no longer 
work
if you convert an access database that was created in 
german  spanish  brazilian  or portuguese versions of 
access  key assignment macros in the autokeys macro group 
might no longer work  in access sr  change the name of 
the autokeys macro group to the english word autokeys  
to enable the key assignment macros  this permits the key 
assignment macros in your database to work as expected in 
any language version of access sr  
message  database  msdb  cannot be opened 
you might receive the message  database  msdb  cannot be 
opened  when using database utilities  database security  
or replication in an access project that is connected to 
a microsoft data engine msde database  this message 
might occur if you selected a character set besides the 
default iso character set in the character setsort 
orderunicode collation dialog box during msde 
installation  and you also accepted the other default 
settings  the default locale identifier is general 
unicode  the casesensitive  widthinsensitive and kana
insensitive check boxes are selected by default  
    to correct the problem with the msdb database 
  click the start button  point to programs  point to 
 msde  and click service manager   stop the msde service  
  click the start button  point to programs  and then 
 click msdos prompt   change to the  binn directory of msde  by default 
 this directory is c  mssql binn   type the following in the case shown 
 sqlservr c t
  repeat steps and    in the second msdos prompt window  type the 
 following in the case shown 
 osql usa p
 use msdb
 checkpoint
 go
 shutdown
 go
 note that the checkpoint command generates a warning 
 that the sort order in the database differs from the

 service cannot log on as  administrator  when modifying page 
connection string
in nonenglish versions of access  if you attempt to 
establish a connection between a database and a data 
access page  and you log on to the database with the user 
name  administrator   you receive the message  not a 
valid account name or password   to modify the connection 
string of a data access page  use the english word 
 admin  as the logon name nonu s   noneast asian  northwind sql project not 
advertised in the user interface
in nonu s  english and noneast asian versions of 
access  the northwind sql project file is not advertised 
in the user interface  you must run the office 
installation program or access sr installation program  
and change the installation setting of the northwind sql 
project file from  installed on first use  to  run from 
my computer  
hyperlink to database object doesn t work with object 
type name in local language
if you click a hyperlink whose subaddress specifies a 
database object  you might receive a message that access 
is not able to follow the hyperlink  this problem occurs 
if the object type string is in the local language 
instead of in english  for example  you might receive the 
message if the subaddress is   localizedreportstring 
 reportname   instead of the english string   report 
 reportname    when you create a hyperlink that points to 
a database object  you can prevent this message by 
clicking object in this database in the insert hyperlink 
or edit hyperlink dialog box  when you select an object 
from the list of objects in the database  access 
automatically creates a hyperlink whose object type 
string is in english righttoleft languages
printing in righttoleft languages
certain printers will require updated printer drivers  
please contact your printer manufacturer if you encounter 
problems printing expression builder limitations for righttoleft 
languages
you can enter and edit expressions directly in the 
properties window of controls or you can use the 
expression builder  if you have mixed righttoleft and 
latin text in your expressions  use the properties 
window  if you use the expression builder  your mixed
text expressions will be correctly transferred to the 
properties window  but the appearance of mixed text might 
be confusing hijri database calendar in sample applications
sample applications such as the northwind database expect 
the database calendar to be gregorian  because the 
sample application contains hardcoded date constants 
that are not valid hijri dates  running the sample 
application with the database calendar set to hijri 
tools startup use hijri calendar is not recommended input mask restrictions for righttoleft languages
input masks that you create for data entry will operate 
as expected only when latin text and numbers are entered  
righttoleft text entered in a field with an input mask 
will produce undesirable masked input behavior hijri calendar support in data access pages and web pages
all databound controls on data access pages and web 
pages can display date values in gregorian calendar 
format  date display in hijri calendar format is also 
possible if certain controls are used  
  office web controls webcalc  pivotlist and webchart 
 support date display in hijri calendar format  the 
 calendar used for date display is determined by the 
 calendar type setting on the date tab of the regional 
 settings properties dialog box available through 
 windows control panel   most other controls used for data binding  such as the 
 intrinsic textbox and label controls of internet 
 explorer   display date values only in gregorian 
 calendar format viewing arabic data in microsoft replication conflict 
viewer and importexport wizards
to view sample information and certain other arabic data 
correctly when running the microsoft replication conflict 
viewer and the importexport wizards  the locale setting 
on the regional settings tab of the regional settings 
dialog box available through the windows control panel 
must be arabic saudi arabia  
east asian languages
possible display problems when using multiple asian fonts
if you install multiple asian fonts on nonasian versions 
of microsoft windows nt server   or microsoft windows 
nt workstation    you might experience display 
problems  such as very large text  blank text  or very 
large blank areas occurring in access sr or in windows

prompt for cd key when installing from an administrative 
installation 
when you install access sr on your computer from an 
administrative installation on a server  you might be 
prompted for a cd key  this occurs if the system 
administrator who created the administrative 
installation did not enter the cd key to solve this problem  ask the system administrator to 
create a new administrative installation and enter the cd 
key in the first dialog box  after this has been done  
you will not be prompted for the cd key when you install 
access sr from this new administrative installation  
message  file already in use  when running access sr 
from a network
if you are running access sr from the network  you 
might receive the following message when you open an 
access database 
 could not use  admin   file already in use this message occurs when a user who has write permissions 
to the network share opens an access database  subsequent 
users who have only read permissions to that share 
receive the message when they attempt to open an access 
database  
after you have run the administrative installation of 
office or access sr  you can prevent this message 
by setting the effective sharelevel permissions to read 
permissions for all users who will run access sr from 
the network server  if you are an administrator  you 
might want to create a separate share to the same folder  
and give any administrators full control permissions so 
that they can maintain the files in this folder  however  
all users should install office or access sr from 
the share with read permissions  
installing access sr over an access runtime 
application
if you are upgrading from access or office on a
computer where you have installed an access runtime 
application  the default installation location for office 
 or access sr is 
 c  program files officek
installing office or access sr to this alternate 
default location ensures that you keep the access 
version of msaccess exe if it is needed by the runtime 
application unexpected message during installation
if you get an unexpected message during the installation 
of office  and you get the same message when you try to 
install office again  you can create a log file that will 
be useful to microsoft product support services in 
troubleshooting the problem  once you create the file  
you will need to call microsoft product support services     to create the log file 
 
  click the start button on the taskbar  and then click 
 run   in the open box  type  
 
  path  setup exe l v c  verboselog txt
 
 where  path  is the location of setup exe  for 
 example  if you are installing from a cdrom drive  
 then the text you would type might look like 
  d  setup exe l v c  verboselog txt
   click ok  
setup will start again and a log file called 
verboselog txt will be created at the root of your c  
drive installing access sr without removing the beta build 
of office 
when starting access sr  you might receive the 
following message  
 required registry information is missing and this 
 application cannot run  please rerun setup to correct 
 this problem  
or  after a few seconds  the program might quit  
you might experience either of the above if you installed 
access sr without removing the beta build b of 
microsoft office      to solve this problem  do the following to remove the 
beta build of office  
  click the start button on the taskbar  point to 
 settings  and click control panel   doubleclick the addremove programs icon   in the list of installed programs  click microsoft 
 office premium edition  this is the beta 
 version of office    click addremove   click remove office   click yes to the prompt confirming that you want to 
 remove access sr shortcut on the programs menu varies 
according to your operating system 
the access sr shortcut on the programs menu might have 
the following problems  
  it does not selfrepair the program  
 this problem occurs because your operating system does 
 not support windows installer shortcuts  only the 
 following versions of microsoft windows support these 
 shortcuts  
   windows 
   windows with internet explorer    service 
 pack and active desktop installed
   microsoft windows nt version with 
 internet explorer    service pack   and 
 active desktop installed  
 note  if you install internet explorer on a computer 
 that has windows or windows nt version with 
 internet explorer    service pack   and active 
 desktop installed  it will still support windows 
 installer shortcuts  
  it does not install the program on first use  
 this problem occurs because installed on first use is 
 not an option for access in the selecting features 
 dialog box during setup  installed on first use is not 
 an option because your operating system does not 
 support windows installer shortcuts  the operating 
 systems listed under   support windows installer 
 shortcuts  
  it does not display a path on the shortcut tab of the 
 properties dialog box for the shortcut  
 this indicates that the shortcut is a windows 
 installer shortcut  windows installer shortcuts do not 
 directly reference the path of the shortcut target  
 instead  they contain a token that the windows 
 installer resolves to the path of the shortcut 
 target  the operating systems listed under item 
 support windows installer shortcuts working with access sr displaying dates with fourdigit years 
in access sr  you can specify that date fields and 
controls display fourdigit years  this helps you to 
ensure that the century of a particular date is correct  
on the general tab of the options dialog box tools 
menu  under use fourdigit year formatting  you can do 
one of the following 
  select the this database check box to display four
 digit years at the database level in the current 
 access database or access project 
  select the all databases check box to display four
 digit years at the application level in all access 
 databases and access projects selecting one of these check boxes only changes how dates 
are displayedit does not change the data itself  these 
options override format property settings for individual 
fields and controls euro symbol not printed correctly 
although the euro symbol might be displayed correctly in 
print preview  it might not print correctly  for example  
it might not appear at all in the printout  or it might
appear as another character  
this behavior can occur if you are using a printer font 
that does not support the euro  to resolve this problem  
first try using a true type font that does support the 
euro  such as arial  courier new  or times new roman  if 
the euro symbol still isn t printed correctly  change the 
spool data format for your printer from emf to raw  
    to change the spool data format for your printer from

problems when using taskbar buttons to navigate between 
multiple data access pages
if you have installed the active desktop  and in internet 
explorer you have cleared the check box to launch 
browser windows in a separate process  you might 
experience problems if you open multiple data access 
pages and move between them by clicking their 
corresponding taskbar buttons  for example  if you open 
one data access page and you then open a second data 
access page in another window  in some cases you might 
not be able to navigate back to the first page until you 
have closed the second page  to prevent this behavior  
start internet explorer  click internet options on the 
tools menu  and on the advanced tab  select the check box 
to launch browser windows in a separate process  
display problems when scrolling through the employees 
form in northwind
in the northwind sample database  the display might 
flicker when you scroll through the records in the 
employees form  
    to prevent this problem  
  in windows control panel  doubleclick the display 
 icon  and then click the settings tab   in the color palette box  click a setting with more 
 than colors  note  if your system does not support more than 
 colors  you will not be able to select a higher 
 setting using northwind sample database located on a readonly 
share
if you open a copy of the northwind sample database that 
is located on a readonly share  you might receive the 
following message 
 there were errors fixing your data access page 
 connections  some pages may not function as expected when you first open the northwind sample database  it 
attempts to fix the connections of its data access pages  
this process checks the file attribute of northwind  if 
the attribute is readonly  the process cannot fix the 
connections  and execution stops without error  however  
the fixup process does not check the permissions of the 
network share where northwind is located  if the share is 
readonly  the connections cannot be fixed  
this behavior may occur in any database containing 
similar code that fixes data access page connections  if 
you are deploying northwind or any database with a 
similar fixup process on a readonly share  you can avoid 
this problem by setting the file attribute of the 
database to readonly  you can also prevent the fixup 
process from running by pressing the shift key while you 
open the northwind sample database  however  this might 
mean that the data access pages will not function as 
expected

against sql server 
you must install office sr or access sr 
updates or better to test your access adp applications against 
sql server   the officeaccess sr updates allow you
to design database diagrams  tables  and views  but do not 
allow you to save your changes  this is due to the metadata 
changes happened between sql server   and sql server   
the sr update also fixes the ability for access forms and 
reports to run against stored procedures  sr supports the 
design and saving of stored procedures future updates of office and access available after 
sql server ships will allow limited design and saving of 
database diagrams  tables  and views                                                          
microsoft jet
ansi compliant sql
the microsoft jet   database engine supports two forms 
of sql syntax  one mode supports the same jet sql 
commands used in previous versions of access  and another 
new mode supports new jet sql commands and syntax that 
are more compliant with the ansi sql standard  the 
mode that supports the sql commands used in previous 
versions of access is the only mode that is available 
through the access sr user interface  the newer sql 
syntax is currently available only in visual basic for 
applications vba procedures that use activex data 
objects ado and the microsoft ole db provider for jet 
version  x  when you use the ole db provider for jet 
version  x through ado  you can execute temporary 
queries i e   queries that are not stored and are used 
as part of a recordset s source by using 
connection execute or command execute or create stored 
queries by using the new create view  create procedure 
syntax  
although you can use ado and the ole db provider for jet 
 x to access all stored queries created through the ole 
db provider for jet  x  they are not visible in the 
access user interface  for example  you cannot set the 
recordsource property of a form to a query created with 
the microsoft activex data objects extensions for ddl and 
security adox version   object library  and you 
cannot import a query created with adox into another 
database  however  you can still use ado code to run 
stored queries created by using adox if you try to save a new query and receive a message that 
the name you entered already exists for another object  
try using a different name  an ansi query with the 
same name might already exist  but might not be visible 
in the objects list in the database window  
for more information about ansi compliant sql with the 
microsoft ole db provider for jet version  x  type 
comparison of jet sql and ansi sql in the office 
assistant or on the answer wizard tab in the help window  
and then click search  
counter and identity 
counter and identity are microsoft jet sql reserved 
words  but they are not jet sql data types  for more 
information about the microsoft jet data types  see the 
microsoft jet database engine programmer s guide

conversion and compatibility
compatibility library
access sr does not ship with the dao   x 
compatibility library  if you attempt to convert an 
access database in which the code contains older versions 
of dao objects  methods  and properties that depend on 
the dao   x compatibility library  you might receive 
a message that there were compilation errors during the 
conversion of the database  if the dao   x 
compatibility library that shipped with a previous 
version of access still exists on your computer  you can 
create a reference to it and then use it  however  before 
you convert an access database on a computer where the 
dao   x compatibility library does not exist  you 
must update the code so that it does not depend on 
that library  
turning on name autocorrect in a converted access 
database
by default  name autocorrect is not turned on in a 
converted access database  to turn on name autocorrect  
click options on the tools menu  click the general tab  
and under name autocorrect  select the appropriate check 
boxes  then open each table  query  form  and report in 
design view  save the object  and close it for more information  type name autocorrect in the 
office assistant or on the answer wizard tab in the help

microsoft access projects 
unexpected behavior when sql statement output contains 
two fields with same name
in an access project   adp  you might see unexpected 
results when you use an sql statement whose output 
contains two or more fields with the same name  for 
example  you might see unexpected behavior when you 
work with a view that is based on two tables and that 
contains two fields that have the same name but are 
located in different tables  to prevent unexpected 
behavior  specify an alias for one of the fields to 
ensure that every field in the output has a unique name  
can t refer to controls in forms or reports in aggregate 
functions
in an access project  your aggregate functions cannot use 
references to controls in objects such as forms or 
reports  for example  you cannot use the following 
expression 
  dlookup categoryname   categories   categoryid   
 reports report categoryid 
rebooting your computer after installing microsoft data 
engine msde
to ensure that microsoft data engine msde runs 
correctly  you must reboot your computer after installing 
msde  if you do not reboot your computer  you might see 
unexpected behavior while using msde  for example  if you 
attempt to create a new publication from an access 
project  you might receive a message that one of the 
library files needed to run this application cannot be 
found error   for more information about msde  type 
work with a microsoft access project in the office 
assistant or on the answer wizard tab in the help window  
and then click search  order by clause may not be used in this query type  when 
view has top clause
when you save a view that contains a top clause and an 
order by clause  you might receive the message  order by 
clause may not be used in this query type   however  when 
you run the query  it returns the correct results and no 
message appears incoming named pipe connections not supported on windows 
 or windows 
you cannot connect to a remote microsoft data engine 
msde or sql server   desktop database located on a 
windows or windows computer unless you use a 
protocol other than named pipes  these platforms do not 
support incoming named pipe connections  to connect to 
the database  run the client network utility 
cliconfg exe  which is located in the windows system 
folder on the client computer  add a server alias that 
specifies the remote server you need to connect to  and 
select tcpip as the default network library  
microsoft data engine rules for naming identifiers
you might see unexpected behavior if you are using a 
microsoft database engine msde database whose name does 
not conform to the following rules for identifiers 
  the first character must be one of the following 
 
 a letter as defined by the unicode standard    the 
 unicode definition of letters includes latin 
 characters az and az  in addition to letter 
 characters from other languages  
 the   underscore    at sign  or   number sign 
 symbol  certain symbols at the beginning of an 
 identifier have special meaning in msde  an identifier 
 beginning with   denotes a local variable or 
 parameter  an identifier beginning with   denotes a 
 temporary table or procedure  an identifier beginning 
 with double number signs    denotes a global 
 temporary object  
 some transactsql functions have names that start with 
 double at signs     to avoid confusion with these 
 functions  it is recommended that you do not use names 
 that start with     
  subsequent characters can be  
 letters as defined in the unicode standard    
 decimal numbers from either basic latin or other 
 national scripts  
 the          or   symbols  
 the identifier must not be a transactsql reserved 
 word  
 msde reserves both the uppercase and lowercase 
 versions of reserved words  
  embedded spaces or special characters are not allowed

multilingual issues
general
code page of client machine must match code page of 
server
for sql server international applications  you may see 
unexpected behavior if the system code page of client 
machines doesn t match the character set of microsoft sql 
server on the server  on the client  the system code page 
is the character set that is used by the language 
specified in operating system  if you are running windows 
nt workstation   or windows nt server    this is the 
default locale  on the server  the character set is 
specified during sql server installation  
in an access project   adp  result sets containing ansi 
text fields are not displayed correctly if the system 
code page of the client computer does not match the 
character set of the sql server to which the client is 
connected  this problem does not occur for data that is 
stored as unicode on the server  
create registry keys to temporarily enforce a code page 
during conversion
access normally uses the code page of the operating 
system to convert previousversion databases to access 
  if you are converting an access database in which 
the code page is different from that of the operating 
system on your computer  create a forcecp entry in the 
windows registry  

the forcecp registry entry temporarily enforces the code 
page that corresponds to the language you are using  the 
code page is the character set that is used by the 
language specified in the regional settings of the 
operating system  you might need to create a forcecp 
registry entry if you don t have the necessary language 
version of the operating system  or if the database is in 
a language for which the previous version of access had 
no sort order support  for example  previous versions of 
access did not support a sort order for vietnamese  
farsi  or a baltic languages estonian  latvian  or 
lithuanian  therefore  the sort order for databases in 
these languages was general  the forcecp registry entry 
allows nonwestern data in your tables to be converted 
correctly  warning  the forcecp registry entry affects 
only tables and queries  nonwestern characters in forms  
reports  macros  and modules might not be converted 
correctly if the code page of the access database doesn t 
match the code page specified by the operating system  
the full subkey you should add will be one of the 
following 
 hkey local machine software microsoft jet    engines jet x forcecp
 hkey local machine software microsoft jet    engines jet x forcecp
if you are converting a database that was created in 
access or later  create the new string value in the 
jet x subkey with the name  if you are converting a 
database that was created in access   or earlier  
create the new string value in the jet x subkey  in 
either case  the name of the entry is  forcecp   the 
value is the number of the code page that you want to 
use  for example  the number of the code page for windows 
baltic rim is  to allow the registry entry to take effect  quit 
access and restart it  after you have converted the 
access database  delete the registry entry so that 
access can resume its normal mode of operation for a more information about customizing windows registry 
settings for microsoft jet  type customize windows 
registry settings in the office assistant or on the 
answer wizard tab in the help window  and then click 
search  
error messages appear in wrong language when using 
language pack
if you are using the office language pack  error 
messages might appear in the wrong language  to ensure 
that error messages appear in the appropriate language  
first back up the u s  versions of the files msjint dll 
and mswstr dll that are located in your  windows system 
folder  then copy the localized versions of the files to 
your  windows system folder you can find localized versions of these files on the 
language pack cd in the following folder  
  extras jet  language 
where  language  is the threeletter abbreviation for the 
language that you are using key assignment macros in autokeys macro group no longer 
work
if you convert an access database that was created in 
german  spanish  brazilian  or portuguese versions of 
access  key assignment macros in the autokeys macro group 
might no longer work  in access sr  change the name of 
the autokeys macro group to the english word autokeys  
to enable the key assignment macros  this permits the key 
assignment macros in your database to work as expected in 
any language version of access sr  
message  database  msdb  cannot be opened 
you might receive the message  database  msdb  cannot be 
opened  when using database utilities  database security  
or replication in an access project that is connected to 
a microsoft data engine msde database  this message 
might occur if you selected a character set besides the 
default iso character set in the character setsort 
orderunicode collation dialog box during msde 
installation  and you also accepted the other default 
settings  the default locale identifier is general 
unicode  the casesensitive  widthinsensitive and kana
insensitive check boxes are selected by default  
    to correct the problem with the msdb database 
  click the start button  point to programs  point to 
 msde  and click service manager   stop the msde service  
  click the start button  point to programs  and then 
 click msdos prompt   change to the  binn directory of msde  by default 
 this directory is c  mssql binn   type the following in the case shown 
 sqlservr c t
  repeat steps and    in the second msdos prompt window  type the 
 following in the case shown 
 osql usa p
 use msdb
 checkpoint
 go
 shutdown

 note that the checkpoint command generates a warning 
 that the sort order in the database differs from the 
 server sort order   close the msdos prompt windows  and restart the msde 
 service cannot log on as  administrator  when modifying page 
connection string
in nonenglish versions of access  if you attempt to 
establish a connection between a database and a data 
access page  and you log on to the database with the user 
name  administrator   you receive the message  not a 
valid account name or password   to modify the connection 
string of a data access page  use the english word 
 admin  as the logon name nonu s   noneast asian  northwind sql project not 
advertised in the user interface
in nonu s  english and noneast asian versions of 
access  the northwind sql project file is not advertised 
in the user interface  you must run the office 
installation program or access sr installation program  
and change the installation setting of the northwind sql 
project file from  installed on first use  to  run from 
my computer  
hyperlink to database object doesn t work with object 
type name in local language
if you click a hyperlink whose subaddress specifies a 
database object  you might receive a message that access 
is not able to follow the hyperlink  this problem occurs 
if the object type string is in the local language 
instead of in english  for example  you might receive the 
message if the subaddress is   localizedreportstring 
 reportname   instead of the english string   report 
 reportname    when you create a hyperlink that points to 
a database object  you can prevent this message by 
clicking object in this database in the insert hyperlink 
or edit hyperlink dialog box  when you select an object 
from the list of objects in the database  access 
automatically creates a hyperlink whose object type 
string is in english righttoleft languages
printing in righttoleft languages
certain printers will require updated printer drivers  
please contact your printer manufacturer if you encounter 
problems printing expression builder limitations for righttoleft 
languages
you can enter and edit expressions directly in the 
properties window of controls or you can use the 
expression builder  if you have mixed righttoleft and 
latin text in your expressions  use the properties 
window  if you use the expression builder  your mixed
text expressions will be correctly transferred to the 
properties window  but the appearance of mixed text might 
be confusing hijri database calendar in sample applications
sample applications such as the northwind database expect 
the database calendar to be gregorian  because the 
sample application contains hardcoded date constants 
that are not valid hijri dates  running the sample 
application with the database calendar set to hijri 
tools startup use hijri calendar is not recommended input mask restrictions for righttoleft languages
input masks that you create for data entry will operate 
as expected only when latin text and numbers are entered  
righttoleft text entered in a field with an input mask 
will produce undesirable masked input behavior hijri calendar support in data access pages and web pages
all databound controls on data access pages and web 
pages can display date values in gregorian calendar
